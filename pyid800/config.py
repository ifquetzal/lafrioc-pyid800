# How to save files:
# cont=True  generates ONLY ONE data file with all registered time-tags.
#			 Default value.
# cont=False generates <total_runs> = n data files with <timestamp_count> total
#            events each.
#			 Recommended for initial experiments to prevent computer crashes.
#
# Data files generated will have the following syntax:
#		'YYMMDD-H  HMM_filename.file_extension'
# Example:
#		'180617-1604_testing.bin'
cont = True
total_runs = '20' # if cont=False, total number of data files to be created
